# Overview
The Real-Time and Distributed Systems research group is concerned with fundamental and applied research into the development and analysis of systems where the distributed nature of the computation, the need for communication and coordination, and/or the timeliness of the system’s actions are of critical importance to the overall functionality and to the end-users.  The group’s research spans many areas, including embedded systems, Internet of Things (IoT), communications, robotics, automotive systems, large scale process control, avionics, distributed computing, and High-Performance Computing (HPC).

Real-time systems are those that are required to respond to inputs within a finite and specified time interval. In some systems, the required response times are measured in milliseconds, in others it is seconds, minutes, or even hours. Nevertheless, they all have timing requirements that must be satisfied. In the production of real-time systems, it is insufficient to use testing of the final system to ensure its compliance with the requirements (as it is infeasible to test all possible timing interference patterns in a system of reasonable complexity). A comprehensive and systematic approach to specification, design, implementation and analysis is required.

Distributed systems are those that divide their workload across networked ‘nodes’ (e.g. processors, computers, embedded devices, robots), which coordinate their actions through message passing. These nodes may be tightly integrated via wired connections (e.g. High Performance Computing platforms), or loosely connected through wireless communication (e.g. IoT devices and robot swarms). Nodes can also be distributed across a variety of spatial scales, from cloud platforms with computation spread across international data centres, to devices located throughout a home, or even networked processors within a single silicon chip. This presents unique challenges in terms of programmability, coordination, communication, and fault tolerance, each demanding consideration of the distributed nature of the system.

The research conducted by the Real-Time and Distributed Systems group is unified around the notions of understanding, modelling, analysing, simulating, optimising, and predicting the performance and use of systems that are real-time and/or distributed in nature.


## Aims and Objectives
Our aim is to undertake fundamental research, and to bring into engineering practice modern techniques, methods and tools.

- To undertake fundamental research, and to bring into engineering practice modern techniques, methods and tools facilitating the design, construction, analysis, optimisation, and maintenance of distributed systems and application-specific systems that have real-time constraints.
- To investigate a wide range of topics associated with scheduling, timing analysis, modelling, simulation, performance optimisation, runtime environments, parallel programming models, communication protocols and hardware platforms, all of them tailored for performance-sensitive systems.
- To address the interdependencies between runtime performance and other requirements such as energy-efficiency, security, safety, and dependability.

In specific,

- How can we design and build time-predictable systems using modern heterogeneous multicore architectures?
- By what means can a system utilise free resources at run-time, to increase system utility, but still be guaranteed to meet its fundamental timing constraints?
- Can a computational model for real-time systems be defined that is effective in terms of schedulability analysis, but can also be formally specified and implemented?
- How can we implement, in combinations of software and hardware, complex real-time systems to meet timing and resource constraints?
- To what extent can real-time systems be made architecture neutral?

## What is Real-time?
A system is defined as being real-time if it is required to respond to input stimuli within a finite and specified time interval. The stimuli being either an event at the interface to the system or some internal clock tick that is, at least notionally, coordinated with the passage of time in the system’s environment. Real-time systems are found in a wide range of applications areas, from simple domestic appliances to multimedia systems, large scale process control and safety critical avionics. In some systems the required response times are measured in milliseconds, in others it is seconds or even minutes. Nevertheless they all have deadlines that must be satisfied. In the production of real-time systems, it is insufficient to use testing of the final system to ensure its compliance with the timing requirements. A comprehensive and systematic approach to specification, design, implementation and analysis is required.

## Areas of Activity
The overall goal of the group is to facilitate the design, construction, analysis and maintenance of potentially complex systems which have real-time constraints. The work of the group spans a wide range of topics associated with timing analysis, system design, programming languages, operating system kernels, heterogeneous and reconfigurable hardware.
