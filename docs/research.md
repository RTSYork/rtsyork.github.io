# Research
The group collaborates extensively with industry. It has been instrumental in the transfer of real-time systems research into commercial products in areas including automotive, aerospace, communications, manufacturing, and robotics, via interactions with large multinational companies, SMEs and start-ups. Recent project partners include Bosch, Rolls Royce, BAE, Airbus, Huawei, OAS, ETAS, Rapita, ONA and Electrolux. The group also works closely with scientists in the York Plasma Institute, the UK Atomic Energy Authority, UK AWE and the US Department of Energy, as well as engineers from vendors such as Intel, NVIDIA and ARM on projects in the HPC area.

The group’s research output is highly valued by the academic community, with talks and publications featuring regularly in the top venues in the areas of real-time systems, communication and networks, robotics, and HPC.

Ultimately, the group’s research enables technologies and products that are more performant, predictable and resource-efficient. Increased performance enables step changes in scientific and engineering capability; predictability enables safety, providing society with technologies that are fit for purpose even under stringent requirements; resource-efficiency makes those technologies economically viable, and minimises their environmental footprint.

Research topics of the group include:
- Real-Time Modelling and Scheduling
- Simulation and Optimization of Cyber-Physical Systems
- Real-Time Hardware
- Swarm Robotics
- High Performance Computing
- IoT and Distributed Systems
